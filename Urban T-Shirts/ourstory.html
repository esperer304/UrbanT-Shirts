          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Urban T-Shirts, where fashion meets individuality. We’re not just a brand – we’re a lifestyle rooted in the heartbeat of the city, shaped by creativity, and inspired by the diverse culture of urban life.</p>

        <section class="history">
          <h3>How It All Began</h3>
          <p>Urban T-Shirts was born from a dream and a sketchpad in a small downtown studio. It all started with the idea of creating apparel that speaks louder than words. Our founder, fueled by a love for bold designs and street culture, began designing t-shirts that captured the energy and pulse of city life. The first designs were simple, but they carried a powerful message of individuality and self-expression.</p>
          <p>Over time, our little studio grew into a thriving community of like-minded dreamers. Through grit, passion, and a belief in the power of art, we’ve expanded from local markets to reaching people all over the globe. Urban T-Shirts has evolved into a brand that celebrates authenticity and originality in every stitch.</p>
